___
```
Nobody can hear
I’m barely breathing
All of my dreams
No longer being in my story

No body can see
Now I'm standing
On the way you lead
Trying everything but fading

Between me and me
Even if it's reality
It won't become new memories

You used to be...
You used to be...
How could you leave?
How could you leave?

You used to be...
You used to be...
How could you leave?
How could you leave?
You used to be me
```
